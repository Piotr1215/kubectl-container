# Kubectl with auto-completion in a docker container

The purpose of this tool is to have a fully portable `kubectl` command line tool with a few convinience utilities.
Quick testing of a cluster with well-known/customized `kubectl` setup.

## What is included

There are two images, one simple image with *bash* shell containing:

- `kubectl` - Kuberneted CLI v 1.19.3 with bash completion
- useful aliases

Use this image if you want to quickly check and explore Kubernetes cluster without investing too much time.
This image is optimized for size performance and is based on ``Apline`` base image and is **16 MB** compressed size.

And one is a fancy image for *zsh* with more tools preinstalled:

- `kubectl` - Kubernetes CLI v 1.17.2 with zsh completion
- `zsh-autosuggestions` - very useful zsh shell plugin showing previous commands and enabling easy autofill of text
- `helm` - Kubernetes package manager
- `okteto` - development platform for Kubernetes applications
- `k9s` - cluster monitoring tool
- `kubectx` - easily switch between Kubernetes contexts
- `kubens` - easily switch between Kubernetes namespaces
- `tmux` based on highly customized, [great repo from samoshkin](https://github.com/samoshkin/tmux-config)
- popular tools: `curl, wget, git`
- useful aliases

Use this image if you want to monitor and develop for Kubernetes. This is my default image with all favourite tools and settings.
This image is optimized for usability and is based on ``Ubuntu`` base image and is **168 MB** compressed size.

## How to use

After running docker container, all the clusters running on the localhost should be available for `kubectl` command.

### Aliases

Make use of aliases defined for both shells *bash* and *zsh*

__Instead of typing kubectl all the time, abbreviate it to just “k”__

    alias k=kubectl

__Check what is running on the cluster__

    alias kdump='kubectl get all --all-namespaces'

__Display helpful info for creating k8s resources imperatively__

    alias krun='k run -h | grep “# “ -A2'

__Quickly spin up busybox pod for diagnostic purposes__

    alias kdiag='kubectl run -it --rm debug --image=busybox --restart=Never -- sh'

## Supported tags

- **zsh**
  docker pull piotrzan/kubectl-comp:zsh
  [Dockerfile](https://github.com/Piotr1215/kubectl-container/blob/master/zsh/Dockerfile)

- **bash**
  docker pull piotrzan/kubectl-comp
  [Dockerfile](https://github.com/Piotr1215/kubectl-container/blob/master/bash/Dockerfile)

## How the images are build

### Build image with bash shell

    docker build --rm -f "Dockerfile" -t piotrzan/kubectl-comp "."

### Build image with zsh shell

    docker build --rm -f "Dockerfile" -t piotrzan/kubectl-comp:zsh "."

## Convinient scripts to run the contianer

Use `run.ps1` or `run.sh` for windows or linux respectivels.
Alternatively use docker-compose.yaml, this works by mounting a volume on the $HOME/.kube folder on the host.

Another option is running `make` (defaults to content of run script). `Make` can be run from root directory and will run images depending on the tasks. Linux has `make` installed by default, for Windows please install first [Make for Windows](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm).

ZSH container will be ran by default.

### Linux Example

By default `make` command will run `zsh` container with direct mount on the *($home)/.kube directory*.

**Run contianer with passthrough to local network**

    docker run -d --network=host --name=kubectl-host --rm -it piotrzan/kubectl-comp

**Generate raw config from kubeclt on localhost and copy the config to the container**

    kubeclt config view --raw > config
    docker cp ./config kubectl-host:./root/.kube

**Attach back to the contianer with kubeconfig file containing info about clusters running on localhost**

    docker attach kubectl-host

## Extending the image

If you would like to add your own customization, you can easily do it and use `docker commit` to create your own version of the image.

`docker commit $(docker ps -aqf "name=kubectl-host") piotrzan/kubectl-comp:zsh` - this captures contianer kubectl-host as a new tag
`docker push piotrzan/kubectl-comp:zsh`
